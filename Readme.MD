# Steam Power Plant Optimization
# This application optimizes the efficiency of a steam power plant using the TESPy library and PyGMO for optimization.

# Features

    Optimization: Automatically optimizes the efficiency of a steam power plant model.
    Visualization: Provides a scatter plot showing optimized parameters and their efficiencies.
    Customization: Allows users to adjust optimization parameters through sliders.
    

# Requirements
    Python 3.11
    Streamlit
    NumPy
    PyGMO
    TESPy
